# Percent Liked

In the waning hours of a digital eve, within the tumultuous scrolls of the Geode Developers' guild (a Discord server, for those less acquainted with modern sorcery), a message was uttered. Nay, not shouted nor proclaimed, but typed—meekly, as if its author knew not the catastrophe it would awaken. It spoke not of monsters nor curses, but of percentages—yes, those infernal mathematical beasts. "Likes divided by downloads," it mused. “Would that not be an intriguing figure to see?”

The winds shifted.

Now, far across the threads and channels, nestled within a cluttered chamber of VSCode windows, there lived a peculiar C++ dev. A creature of habit, powered by compilers and spite. He read the message not with curiosity, but with that familiar twinge of deranged inspiration that plagues those who live too long among pointers and memory leaks.

"A ratio?" he croaked, blinking once. "That’s… division."

And lo, as if possessed by the gods of spaghetti and premature optimization, the dev began. Not with deliberation. Not with grace. But with the frantic, haphazard keypresses of one who knew not where he was going, only that it would compile eventually.

He reached for the sacred headers— <Geode/Geode.hpp>, <Geode/modify/LevelInfoLayer.hpp>, and that hallowed relic, <iostream> (for some reason). And then, almost apologetically, he added the logic. Divide the level’s likes by its downloads. Multiply by 100. Format it. Display it. A label, small and unassuming, beneath the Likes count. A whisper in the void.

The deed was done.

But nay, do not mistake this act for glory. This was not a project born of toil and polish. This mod—this thing—was forged in minutes. Minutes, I tell you. It was not “developed,” it was spat into existence by a dev who had once wrestled with Group Parent inheritance and now simply wanted to commit a mild act of UI vandalism.

And so it persists. A little number, haunting the Level Info Layer like a ghost of opinions past. It does not lie. It does not flatter. It merely calculates—soulless, blunt, true.

Some say it’s useful. Others say it’s useless. But all agree: it exists. Because one dev, upon seeing one message, shrugged and said:

"Yeah, sure. I can slap that in."

And slap it he did.
